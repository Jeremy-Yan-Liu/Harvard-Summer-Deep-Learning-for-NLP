The picture above shows an “interlingua”, a universal structure of the human language from 
[Google AI post](http://ai.googleblog.com/2016/11/zero-shot-translation-with-googles.html).

This repository is my homework for [Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing](https://www.summer.harvard.edu/course-catalog/courses/deep-learning-for-natural-language-processing/34452?keyword=deep%20learning)
in [Harvard Summer School](https://www.summer.harvard.edu).

It's a rather interesting and inspiring course in deep learning thanks to Professor 
[Zoran B. Djordjevic, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zoran-djordjevic-17709925/). 

I'm strongly interested in Natural Language Processing, especially in Machien Transaltion.

Feel free to contact me @yl1023@georgetown.edu if you find this repository useful or share the same passion as mine.
